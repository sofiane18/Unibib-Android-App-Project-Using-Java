## Project Overview

The university library is a crucial resource for students and professors. Traditional library management systems can often be inefficient, leading to delays and difficulties in accessing resources. This project, developed as a final requirement for a Bachelor's in Computer Science at Mohamed Khider University of Biskra, aims to modernize the university library system by providing a dedicated **Android mobile application (developed in Java)**. The app facilitates easier book searching, reservations, and management for both library users (students, professors) and administrators, communicating with a **PHP & MySQL backend** using the **Volley library** for network requests.

## Problem Statement

Based on observations of traditional library workflows, several challenges were identified:

> L‚Äôun des probl√®mes qui surviennent √† la biblioth√®que et qui constituent un obstacle, que ce soit pour les √©tudiants ou pour les administrateurs de la biblioth√®que, est l‚Äôaccumulation de demandes, la perturbation du syst√®me de gestion et l‚Äôattente prolong√©e de l‚Äô√©tudiant pour recevoir le livre.

**Translation & Summary:**
One of the significant problems faced in libraries, hindering both students and administrators, includes:
*   **Accumulation of Requests:** Backlogs in processing book requests.
*   **Management System Disruptions:** Potential inefficiencies or interruptions in the existing management process.
*   **Prolonged Waiting Times:** Students experiencing significant delays in receiving requested books.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop a mobile application that addresses the identified problems by:

*   **Enhancing Efficiency:** Streamlining the process of borrowing, returning, and managing library resources.
*   **Improving Accessibility:** Allowing students and staff to interact with the library system remotely via the mobile app.
*   **Reducing Wait Times:** Providing real-time information and potentially faster processing of requests.
*   **Simplifying Management:** Offering administrators tools for easier management of inventory, users, and requests.
*   **Providing Real-time Updates:** Keeping users informed about book availability, due dates, and request statuses.

## Key Features

### For Users (Students/Professors)

*   **Authentication:** Secure login/signup process.
*   **Book Browsing & Searching:** Search for books by title, author, ID, tags, etc.
*   **Book Details:** View detailed information about books (description, availability, location).
*   **Book Reservation:** Request/reserve available books.
*   **Borrowing Management:** View currently borrowed books and their due dates (potentially renewal functionality).
*   **Notifications:** Receive alerts for due dates, available reservations, etc. (Implementation dependent).

### For Library Administrators

*   **Authentication:** Secure login with admin privileges.
*   **Resource Management:** Add, update, or remove books and their details in the catalogue.
*   **User Management:** View and manage user accounts (potentially).
*   **Request Handling:** Manage book reservation requests from users.
*   **Inventory Tracking:** Monitor book availability and borrowing status.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend (Android Application)

*   **IDE:** Android Studio
*   **Language:** Java
*   **SDK:** Android SDK
*   **Libraries:**
    *   AndroidX Libraries
    *   **Glide:** For efficient image loading and display.
    *   **Volley:** For handling network requests (communication with the PHP backend).
    *   **SQLite:** (Potentially used for local caching or offline data storage within the app).

### Backend (Server)

*   **Language:** PHP
*   **Web Server:** Apache (via XAMPP)
*   **Database:** MySQL / MariaDB (Managed via phpMyAdmin in XAMPP)
*   **Environment:** XAMPP

## Architecture

The system follows a typical **Client-Server architecture**:

1.  **Client:** The native Android application (Java) serves as the front-end, providing the user interface and handling user interactions.
2.  **Server:** A PHP-based backend hosted on an Apache server handles business logic, processes requests from the Android app, and interacts with the database.
3.  **Database:** A MySQL/MariaDB database stores all persistent data, including user information, book catalogue, borrowing records, etc.
4.  **Communication:** The Android app communicates with the PHP backend via RESTful APIs (likely), using HTTP requests handled by the **Volley library**, possibly exchanging data in JSON format.

## Diagrams

This project includes several design diagrams to illustrate its structure and functionality:

1.  **Use Case Diagram:** Shows interactions between users (Utilisateur, Etudiant, Prof) and the system functionalities (Connecter, Chercher un livre, Demander un nouveau livre, Authentification).
2.  **Class Diagrams:** Detail the structure of the Android application classes (e.g., `LoginActivity`, `SignUpAdditionalPersonalInfoActivity`, `UserMainAppBooksSearchActivity`, `AdminBooksBookItem`, `User`) and their relationships.
3.  **Database Schema Diagram:** Outlines the structure of the database tables (`users`, `admins`, `books`, `bookshelves`, `bookplace`, `demands`, `borrowings`, `invitation`) and their columns and relationships.

<!-- Suggestion: Create a '/diagrams' folder in your repo and add the images -->
*You can find the visual diagrams used during development in the `/diagrams` folder (or link to your presentation if available).*

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Backend Server

1.  **Prerequisites:** Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) (includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, phpMyAdmin).
2.  **Clone Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
3.  **Place Backend Code:** Copy the contents of the `backend-php-server` directory from the cloned repo into your XAMPP `htdocs` folder (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/library_server`).
4.  **Start XAMPP:** Launch the XAMPP Control Panel and start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.
5.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Open phpMyAdmin (usually `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    *   Create a new database (e.g., `unibibappdatabase`).
    *   Import the provided SQL schema file (`database_schema.sql` - **Note:** You need to create and include this file!) into the newly created database.
6.  **Configuration (if necessary):** Check the PHP scripts within the backend code for any database connection configuration files (e.g., `db_config.php`, `connect.php`) and ensure the database name, username (usually 'root' for local XAMPP), and password (usually empty for local XAMPP) are correct.

### Frontend Android App

1.  **Prerequisites:** Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2.  **Clone Repository:** (If not already done) `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
3.  **Open Project:** In Android Studio, select `File > Open` and navigate to the `frontend-android-app` directory within the cloned repository.
4.  **Gradle Sync:** Allow Android Studio to sync the project and download any necessary dependencies (check Gradle version compatibility if needed).
5.  **Configuration:**
    *   **API Endpoint:** Locate the part of the Android code where the backend server URL is defined (often in a constants file, e.g., `Constants.java` or `ApiConfig.java`).
    *   **Update URL:** Change the base URL to point to your local XAMPP server's IP address and the backend directory (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100/library_server/` - replace `192.168.1.100` with your computer's local IP address, **not** `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` if testing on a physical device).
6.  **Build & Run:** Build the project and run it on an Android emulator or a physical device connected via USB. Ensure the device/emulator can access your computer over the local network if using a physical device.

## Usage

1.  Launch the Android application.
2.  **Sign Up / Login:** Create a new user account or log in using existing credentials.
3.  **Browse/Search:** Navigate the app to search for books using various criteria.
4.  **Reserve:** Select a book and use the reservation feature if available.
5.  **Admin Functions (if logged in as Admin):** Access administrative panels to manage books, users, or requests.

## Future Work

Potential improvements and future features for this application could include:

*   **Advanced Recommendation System:** Suggest books based on user history.
*   **Integration:** Connect with other campus services or e-learning platforms.
*   **Enhanced Notifications:** More granular controls and types of notifications.
*   **Book Renewal Feature:** Allow users to renew borrowed items directly through the app.
*   **Offline Support:** Limited functionality when the user is offline.
